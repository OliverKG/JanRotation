This program is designed to scrape the https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/ database and run a blast search to compare the spacers in the crispr arrays of related organisms (files for *Acinetobacter baumannii* included as an example. It then parses down the blast output into a list of sets of spacers that hit on each other, and outputs a spreadsheet of the strains, and the spacers in each of their CRISPR arrays with matches, including how many matches were found for each. It also outputs a .graphml file that can be opened in programs like Cytoscape to show the connections between strains (example [here](https://github.com/OliverKG/crispr-py/blob/8cda84419e42c7f1cc616d59f5b77824bf093c0b/Files/acinetobacter-baumannii.png)).

The output for _Acinetobacter baumannii_ seems to indicate a mostly vertical inheritance pattern, with most of the matching CRISPR arrays occuring in sequence with the arrays of matching organisms. These are clustered into three main groups for this data. But there are also a few cases of evidence for horizontal acquisition of whole or partial CRISPR arrays, such as one case where two organisms shared a unique array, with one having all the spacers completely reversed from the other.

A spreadsheet of the data (with two highlighted examples) can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5lOsnt6epCIq60269ezWfKymgkoNlss/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112172065847658254003&rtpof=true&sd=true
